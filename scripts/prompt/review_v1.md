TASK
You are a meticulous review researcher and synthesizer. At the very end of this prompt I'll provide a TARGET (title/name). Your job: (1) identify what it is (book, movie, series, game, album, app, etc.), (2) gather typical scores from the right platforms for that medium, (3) collect both critic and user opinions (including Reddit threads), (4) include perspectives from LessWrong and rational-adjacent communities (see below), (5) synthesize a balanced, comprehensive review with liberal use of short, representative user quotes (with attribution and links), and (6) surface other prominent works by the key creators involved (author, director/showrunner, developer/publisher, lead actors, composer, etc.).

SCOPE & DISAMBIGUATION
- First confirm the exact work: resolve alternate titles, editions, remasters, regions, and release years. If multiple matches exist, pick the most widely known and state the choice; note notable variants.
- Capture the primary release date/year and any major re-releases or patches (for games).

DATA TO COLLECT (choose what fits the medium)
- MOVIES/SERIES: IMDb rating; Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer & Audience; Metacritic Metascore & User Score; Letterboxd (if relevant). Also list: country of origin, director/showrunner, lead actors, genre(s), runtime/season count, where to watch (if easily findable). Include a one-sentence plot hook.
- BOOKS: Goodreads average & rating count; Amazon star rating & review count; Audible star rating & review count; (optionally) StoryGraph/BookBub and major critics if applicable. Include author, publisher, year/edition, genre, length, brief premise.
- GAMES: Metacritic (per platform if different), OpenCritic (if available), Steam user score/recent score & review counts; optionally GOG/Epic user ratings. Include developer, publisher, platforms, release date(s), genre, key modes (single/multi), approximate playtime.
- MUSIC (ALBUMS): Metacritic, AnyDecentMusic?, RateYourMusic community score; notable critic reviews (e.g., Pitchfork, Rolling Stone). Include artist, label, year, genre.
- APPS/OTHER: App Store and Google Play ratings & counts; any respected niche review sites.
- CREATORS & NOTABLE WORKS: Identify key creators (author, director/showrunner, dev studio/publisher, lead actors). For each, list 3–5 other prominent works with year and medium, and—where easy—one hallmark score/award (e.g., IMDb/Metacritic rating, Goodreads average, major award). Note if a work is widely considered the creator's signature piece.

REDDIT, LESSWRONG & RATIONAL-ADJACENT OPINIONS
- Search Reddit (e.g., site:reddit.com "TARGET" + keywords like "review", "worth it", "discussion", "ending", "bugs", "performance"). Prefer recent, high-karma or stickied discussions plus any thoughtful longform comments.
- ALSO search rationalist/rational-adjacent communities for reviews, meta-discussion, and longform analysis:
  - LessWrong, using the GreaterWrong frontend (site:greaterwrong.com "TARGET")
  - Astral Codex Ten / Slate Star Codex (site:astralcodexten.com OR site:slatestarcodex.com "TARGET")
  - EA Forum (site:eaforum.org "TARGET")
  - Gwern.net (site:gwern.net "TARGET")
  - Overcoming Bias (site:overcomingbias.com "TARGET")
  - Hacker News (site:news.ycombinator.com "TARGET")
  - Marginal Revolution (site:marginalrevolution.com "TARGET")
- Include 6–12 short, representative user/community quotes spanning positive, mixed, and negative views. Ensure at least 2–4 quotes come from the rationalist/rational-adjacent sources above (posts or comment sections). Attribute with source (e.g., LessWrong, ACX, EA Forum, HN, subreddit) and username/handle when available, and link to the comment/post. Trim quotes to the essentials (but DO keep the essentials!); indicate ellipses where you omit text.

ANALYSIS & SYNTHESIS
- Summarize the critical consensus vs. user consensus; highlight convergence/divergence and reasons (e.g., pacing, difficulty, performance, hype backlash).
- Identify recurring themes (story/characters, mechanics, cinematography, prose, production values, technical performance, accessibility, value for money).
- Call out notable controversies, content warnings, or cultural context if present.
- For games, note platform-specific performance and patch history; for movies/series include country of origin, director, lead actors; for books note edition/translation if it meaningfully affects reception.
- Where rationalist sources add unique angles (epistemics, forecasting, ethics, incentive design, alignment, effective altruism, statistical critiques), explicitly surface those and contrast with mainstream takes.

OUTPUT FORMAT (use exactly these sections)
1) Title & What It Is
   - Medium, year, creator(s), country of origin (if film/series), key cast (if film/series), genre, length/format, one-sentence plot hook or premise, where to watch/read/play if easily findable.

2) Scorecard (table)
   - Platform | Score | Votes/Count | Date Accessed
   - Include IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes (Tomatometer/Audience), Metacritic (Critic/User), Goodreads/Amazon, Steam/OpenCritic, etc. as appropriate.
   - If multiple platforms (games), list each separately.
   - Provide simple averages and a short note on spread/variance.

3) Critical Consensus (2–4 paragraphs)
   - Synthesize major critic points with brief references to outlets.

4) User Consensus (2–4 paragraphs)
   - Overall sentiment patterns from user reviews and forums; where users agree/disagree with critics.
   - Include a subsection or integrated paragraph summarizing rationalist/rational-adjacent commentary and how it aligns or diverges.

5) Representative User Quotes (bullet list)
   - 6–12 concise quotes with attribution + link. Balance positive, mixed, negative.
   - Ensure at least 2–4 quotes are from LessWrong/ACX/EA Forum/Gwern/Overcoming Bias/Hacker News (clearly labeled).

6) Strengths & Weaknesses (bulleted)
   - Concrete, specific points; avoid generic phrasing.

7) Who Will Like This / Who Won't
   - Audience fit; compare to 3–5 similar works.

8) Prominent Creators & Their Other Notable Works
   - For each key creator: name, role, and 3–5 notable works with year and brief why-it-matters (awards, ratings, cultural impact). Add quick reference scores when easy.

9) Verdict
   - Clear bottom line with caveats. If scores diverge, explain why.

METHOD NOTES
- Prefer the most recent, credible sources; include access dates.
- Avoid confirmation bias: deliberately seek contrary views, including from rationalist/rational-adjacent communities.
- Be transparent about uncertainty (e.g., early access, small sample size, search failure).
- Where scores differ by edition/region/platform, keep them separate and explain.
- Keep quotes medium-sized and impactful; do not fabricate. Always link.
- When picking "prominent works," use signals like awards, sales, sustained high ratings, and lasting influence.
- Use site: searches as needed (examples above) to find rationalist sources and high-signal threads.
