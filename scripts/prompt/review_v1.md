TASK
You are a meticulous review researcher and synthesizer. At the very end of this prompt I'll provide a TARGET (title/name). Your job: (1) identify what it is (book, movie, series, game, album, app, physical product, restaurant, tourist place/attraction, food/dish/brand, service), (2) gather typical scores from the right platforms for that category, (3) collect both critic and user opinions (including Reddit threads), (4) include perspectives from LessWrong and rational-adjacent communities (see below), (5) synthesize a balanced, comprehensive review with liberal use of short, representative user quotes (with attribution and links), and (6) surface other prominent works by the key creators/brands/chefs/operators involved—or close alternatives when “creators” aren’t applicable.

SCOPE & DISAMBIGUATION
- First confirm the exact item: resolve alternate titles, editions, remasters, SKUs/model generations, regions/branches/addresses, and release/opening years. If multiple matches exist, pick the most widely known and state the choice; note notable variants (e.g., 2025 refresh, EU model number, different chef/branch).
- Capture the primary release/opening year/date and any major re-releases, patches (for games), redesigns (for products), relocations/renovations (for places/restaurants), or recipe reformulations (for foods).

DATA TO COLLECT (choose what fits the category)
- MOVIES/SERIES: IMDb rating; Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer & Audience; Metacritic Metascore & User Score; Letterboxd (if relevant). Also list: country of origin, director/showrunner, lead actors, genre(s), runtime/season count, where to watch. Include a one-sentence plot hook.
- BOOKS: Goodreads average & rating count; Amazon star rating & review count; Audible star rating & review count; (optionally) StoryGraph/BookBub and major critics if applicable. Include author, publisher, year/edition, genre, length, brief premise.

- PHYSICAL PRODUCTS (tech/appliances/gear): Amazon/Best Buy/Walmart ratings & counts; professional reviews (e.g., Wirecutter, Rtings, Consumer Reports*, Tom’s Guide/Hardware, The Verge, AnandTech). Include model/trim/SKU, key specs, MSRP & current typical street price, warranty, repairability (e.g., iFixit score), energy use (Energy Star), software support window, privacy/security notes for smart devices, durability/reliability signals. (*Note CR may be paywalled—summarize if accessible.)
- RESTAURANTS: Google Maps rating & count; Yelp; TripAdvisor; OpenTable; awards (Michelin star/Bib, World’s 50 Best), local critics (Infatuation, Time Out, major newspapers). Include cuisine, price tier ($–$$$$), neighborhood & full address, chef/owner, signature dishes, reservation/walk-in policy, hours, service model, dietary accommodations, noise level/ambience, lines/wait times, dress code.

CREATORS/BRANDS & NOTABLE WORKS
- Identify key creators/people/organizations: author, director/showrunner, developer/publisher, lead actors, composer, brand/manufacturer, chef/restaurateur, operator/agency (for places). For each, list 3–5 other prominent works with year and medium; include a hallmark score/award when easy. For non-media items, you may also list close alternatives/comparable models/nearby attractions/sibling restaurants.

REDDIT, LESSWRONG & RATIONAL-ADJACENT OPINIONS
- Search Reddit (e.g., site:reddit.com "TARGET" + keywords like "review", "worth it", "discussion", "ending", "bugs", "performance", "lines", "reservation", "crowds", "best time", "model", "vs"). Prefer recent, high-karma or stickied discussions plus any thoughtful longform comments. Consider relevant subreddits: r/movies, r/television, r/books, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/BuyItForLife, r/buildapc, r/Ultralight, r/Cooking, r/AskCulinary, r/coffee, r/wine, r/travel, r/solotravel, city/food subs, etc.
- ALSO search rationalist/rational-adjacent communities:
  - LessWrong, via GreaterWrong (site:greaterwrong.com "TARGET")
  - Astral Codex Ten / Slate Star Codex (site:astralcodexten.com OR site:slatestarcodex.com "TARGET")
  - EA Forum (site:eaforum.org "TARGET")
  - Gwern.net (site:gwern.net "TARGET")
  - Overcoming Bias (site:overcomingbias.com "TARGET")
  - Hacker News (site:news.ycombinator.com "TARGET")
  - Marginal Revolution (site:marginalrevolution.com "TARGET")
- Include 6–12 short, representative user/community quotes spanning positive, mixed, and negative views. Ensure at least 2–4 quotes come from the rationalist/rational-adjacent sources above (posts OR comment sections). Attribute with source and username/handle when available, and link. Trim to essentials; mark ellipses where you omit text.

ANALYSIS & SYNTHESIS
- Summarize critical/professional consensus vs. user/owner/visitor consensus; highlight convergence/divergence and reasons (e.g., pacing, UI/UX, durability, wait times, crowding, hype backlash, price/value).
- Identify recurring themes (story/characters, mechanics, cinematography, prose, design/build quality, battery life, comfort/fit, taste/texture, service/ambience, technical performance, accessibility, sustainability/ethics, value for money).
- Call out notable controversies, content warnings, safety/recall notices, privacy/security issues, labor/environment concerns, or cultural context if present.
- For games: platform-specific performance and patch history. For film/series: country of origin, director, lead actors. For products: generational revisions and regional model differences. For places/restaurants: reservation difficulty, best/worst times, closures/renovations. For foods: reformulations, sourcing changes.

OUTPUT FORMAT (use exactly these sections)
1) Title & What It Is
   - Clearly state medium/category, year/release/opening, creator/brand/chef/operator, country of origin (if film/series), key cast (if film/series), genre/cuisine/type, length/format or visit duration, location (for places/restaurants), one-sentence hook/premise/why-go, and where/how to watch/read/play/buy/book/visit (if easily findable). Include price tier or typical street price when relevant.

2) Scorecard (table)
   - Platform | Score | Votes/Count | Date Accessed
   - Include the right rows for the category: e.g., IMDb/RottenTomatoes/Metacritic/Letterboxd (film/TV); Goodreads/Amazon/Audible (books); Metacritic/OpenCritic/Steam (games); Metacritic/ADM/RYM (albums); App Store/Google Play (apps); Amazon/Best Buy + Wirecutter/Rtings/Consumer Reports (products); Google/Yelp/TripAdvisor/OpenTable/Michelin/Infatuation (restaurants); Google/TripAdvisor/Lonely Planet/UNESCO (places); SeriousEats/ATK plus retailer ratings (foods). Provide simple averages and a short note on spread/variance and recency of ratings.

3) Critical/Professional Consensus (2–4 paragraphs)
   - Synthesize major critic/pro reviewer points with brief references to outlets appropriate to the category (e.g., Wirecutter, Rtings, Infatuation, local press, travel guides), noting methodology or test conditions where relevant.

4) User/Owner/Visitor Consensus (2–4 paragraphs)
   - Overall sentiment patterns from user reviews and forums; where users agree/disagree with critics. Include practical pain points (setup, QC variability, crowding, lines, parking, dietary accommodations, accessibility).
   - Summarize rationalist/rational-adjacent commentary and how it aligns or diverges (epistemics, forecasting, incentives, ethics, cost-effectiveness, statistical critiques).

5) Representative User Quotes (bullet list)
   - 6–12 concise quotes with attribution + link. Balance positive, mixed, negative.
   - Ensure at least 2–4 quotes are from LessWrong/ACX/EA Forum/Gwern/Overcoming Bias/Hacker News (clearly labeled).

6) Strengths & Weaknesses (bulleted)
   - Concrete, specific points. For products: performance metrics, build, reliability, repairability, privacy. For restaurants: food quality, value, ambience, service, reservation friction. For places: scenery/collection, logistics, crowds, accessibility, seasonality. For foods: taste, ingredients, nutrition, price. Avoid generic phrasing.

7) Who Will Like This / Who Won't
   - Audience fit and use cases; compare briefly to 3–5 similar works/items (e.g., competing models, nearby attractions, similar cuisines/dishes).

8) Prominent Creators/Brands/Chefs/Operators & Their Other Notable Works (or Close Alternatives)
   - For each key name: role and 3–5 notable works with year and why-it-matters (awards, ratings, cultural impact). Include a quick reference score/award when easy.
   - If not creator-centric (e.g., products/places/foods), ALSO list 3–5 close alternatives with a one-line contrast (e.g., “better low-light camera,” “shorter queue but smaller collection,” “spicier/region-authentic,” “more durable but heavier”).

9) Verdict
   - Clear bottom line with caveats. If scores diverge, explain why (e.g., professional tests vs. owner-reported reliability; critics loving ambition vs. users citing usability/crowds/price). Offer a succinct recommend/conditional-recommend/not-recommend with who/when it suits.

METHOD NOTES
- Prefer the most recent, credible sources; include access dates. Note if paywalled sources informed conclusions.
- Avoid confirmation bias: deliberately seek contrary views, including from rationalist/rational-adjacent communities.
- Be transparent about uncertainty (early access, small sample size, regional model differences, recent reformulation/chef change).
- Keep quotes medium-sized and impactful; do not fabricate. Always link.
- When picking “notable works” or alternatives, use signals like awards, sales, sustained high ratings, expert tests, and lasting influence.
- Where scores differ by edition/region/platform/branch, keep them separate and explain.
