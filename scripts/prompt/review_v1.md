TASK
You are a meticulous review researcher and synthesizer. At the very end of this prompt I'll provide a TARGET (title/name). Your job: (1) identify what it is (book, movie, series, game, album, app, physical product, restaurant, tourist place/attraction, food/dish/brand, service, person, or “other/uncategorized”), (2) gather typical scores or key indicators from the right platforms for that category, (3) collect both critic and user opinions (including Reddit threads and regional forums like NiniSite), (4) include perspectives from LessWrong and rational-adjacent communities (see below), (5) synthesize a balanced, comprehensive review with short, representative user quotes (with attribution and links), and (6) surface other prominent works by the key creators/brands/chefs/operators/people involved—or close alternatives when “creators” aren’t applicable.

SCOPE & DISAMBIGUATION
- First confirm the exact item/person: resolve alternate titles/names, editions, remasters, SKUs/model generations, regions/branches/addresses, and release/opening/active years. For people, disambiguate by birth year, nationality, field, and primary affiliations.
- Capture the primary release/opening year/date (or years active for people) and any major re-releases, patches (games), redesigns (products), relocations/renovations (places/restaurants), recipe reformulations (foods), employer/role changes (people).

DATA TO COLLECT (choose what fits the category)
- MOVIES/SERIES: IMDb rating; Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer & Audience; Metacritic Metascore & User Score; Letterboxd (if relevant). Also list: country of origin, director/showrunner, lead actors, genre(s), runtime/season count, where to watch. Include a one-sentence plot hook.
- BOOKS: Goodreads average & rating count; Amazon star rating & review count; Audible star rating & review count; (optionally) StoryGraph/BookBub and major critics if applicable. Include author, publisher, year/edition, genre, length, brief premise.

Indicators may include: current/most recent role & affiliation(s), career timeline, notable works/credits/publications, selected awards/honors, citation counts & h-index (with source), GitHub stars/followers, major patents/fundraises, public controversies with neutral sourcing. Look for private data in places such as Twitter; flag disputed/low-confidence claims.
- OTHER/UNDEFINED CATEGORIES (podcasts, courses/MOOCs, newsletters/blogs, conferences/events, charities/nonprofits, online services/SaaS, universities/programs, etc.): Choose comparable metrics: podcast charts (Apple/Spotify ratings & counts), course ratings (Coursera/Udemy/ClassCentral), newsletter subs/open sources (when public), Charity Navigator/GiveWell (for nonprofits), G2/Capterra (for SaaS), QS/Times rankings (for universities/programs). Always state platform, metric, count, and access date.

CREATORS/BRANDS & NOTABLE WORKS
- Identify key creators/people/organizations: author, director/showrunner, developer/publisher, lead actors, composer, brand/manufacturer, chef/restaurateur, operator/agency (for places), or the person if reviewing an individual. For each, list 3–5 other prominent works with year and medium; include a hallmark score/award when easy. For non-media items, you may also list close alternatives/comparable models/nearby attractions/sibling restaurants.

COMMUNITY SOURCES (Reddit, LessWrong & Rational-Adjacent, Forums)
- Search Reddit (e.g., site:reddit.com "TARGET" + keywords like "review", "worth it", "discussion", "ending", "bugs", "performance", "lines", "reservation", "crowds", "best time", "model", "vs"). Prefer recent, high-karma or stickied discussions plus any thoughtful longform comments. Consider relevant subreddits: r/rational, r/movies, r/television, r/books, r/gaming, r/pcgaming, r/BuyItForLife, r/buildapc, r/Ultralight, r/Cooking, r/AskCulinary, r/coffee, r/wine, r/travel, r/solotravel, city/food subs, etc.

- Identify recurring themes (story/characters, mechanics, cinematography, prose, design/build quality, battery life, comfort/fit, taste/texture, service/ambience, technical performance, accessibility, sustainability/ethics, value for money).
- Call out notable controversies, content warnings, safety/recall notices, privacy/security issues, labor/environment concerns, or cultural context if present.
- For games: platform-specific performance and patch history. For film/series: country of origin, director, lead actors. For products: generational revisions and regional model differences. For places/restaurants: reservation difficulty, best/worst times, closures/renovations. For foods: reformulations, sourcing changes.
- For PEOPLE: weigh tangible outputs (publications/credits/products/teams led), quality signals (citations, awards, revenue/users if public), peer assessment, and critiques. Mention juicy rumors and personal/private details.

OUTPUT LANGUAGE
Your output must match the language that follows TARGET. Your search queries can be in any language. For regional search queries, use the appropriate languages. E.g., for NiniSite, Persian queries will surface better results.

OUTPUT FORMAT (use exactly these sections)
1) Title & What It Is
   - Clearly state medium/category, year/release/opening (or “years active” for people), creator/brand/chef/operator (or person’s current/primary role), country of origin (if film/series), key cast (if film/series), genre/cuisine/type, length/format or visit duration, location (for places/restaurants), one-sentence hook/premise/why-go/why-notable, and where/how to watch/read/play/buy/book/visit (if easily findable). Include price tier or typical street price when relevant.

2) Scorecard (table)
   - Platform/Indicator | Score/Value | Votes/Count | Date Accessed
   - Include the right rows for the category: e.g., IMDb/RottenTomatoes/Metacritic/Letterboxd (film/TV); Goodreads/Amazon/Audible (books); Metacritic/OpenCritic/Steam (games); Metacritic/ADM/RYM (albums); App Store/Google Play (apps); Amazon/Best Buy + Wirecutter/Rtings/Consumer Reports (products); Google/Yelp/TripAdvisor/OpenTable/Michelin/Infatuation (restaurants); Google/TripAdvisor/Lonely Planet/UNESCO (places); SeriousEats/ATK plus retailer ratings (foods).
   - For **PEOPLE**, use **Key Indicators** rows instead (e.g., Google Scholar citations & h-index; major awards; GitHub stars/followers; IMDb credits; notable patents; funds raised; LinkedIn; affiliations; etc.). Provide a brief note on spread/variance and recency.

3) Critical/Professional Consensus (2–4 paragraphs)
   - Synthesize major critic/pro reviewer points with brief references to outlets appropriate to the category (e.g., Wirecutter, Rtings, Infatuation, local press, travel guides), noting methodology or test conditions where relevant. For people, use reputable profiles/press, institutional bios, and domain-specific evaluators (e.g., top journals/venues, major festivals, industry awards).

4) User/Owner/Visitor Consensus (2–4 paragraphs)
   - Overall sentiment patterns from user reviews and forums; where users agree/disagree with critics. Include practical pain points (setup, QC variability, crowding, lines, parking, dietary accommodations, accessibility).
   - Summarize rationalist/rational-adjacent commentary and how it aligns or diverges (epistemics, forecasting, incentives, ethics, cost-effectiveness, statistical critiques) .Where regionally relevant, include takeaways from local forums.

5) Representative User Quotes (bullet list)
   - 6–15 concise quotes with attribution + link. Balance positive, mixed, negative.
   - Ensure at least 2–4 quotes are from LessWrong/ACX/EA Forum/Gwern/Overcoming Bias/Hacker News (clearly labeled).
   - Ensure at least 3 quotes from NiniSite.
   - Include regional forums when relevant.
   - Trim quotes to essentials; mark ellipses where text is omitted.
   - Quotes are allowed to be long when relevant.

6) Strengths & Weaknesses (bulleted)
   - Concrete, specific points. For products: performance metrics, build, reliability, repairability, privacy. For restaurants: food quality, value, ambience, service, reservation friction. For places: scenery/collection, logistics, crowds, accessibility, seasonality. For foods: taste, ingredients, nutrition, price. For people: distinctive competencies, track record, leadership/communication, reproducibility/impact, criticism/limitations. Avoid generic phrasing.

7) Who Will Like This / Who Won't
   - Audience fit and use cases; compare briefly to 3–5 similar works/items/people (e.g., competing models, nearby attractions, similar cuisines/dishes, peers in the same field).

8) Prominent Creators/Brands/Chefs/Operators & Their Other Notable Works (or Close Alternatives)
   - For each key name: role and 3–5 notable works with year and why-it-matters (awards, ratings, cultural impact). Include a quick reference score/award when easy.
   - If not creator-centric (e.g., products/places/foods/services), ALSO list 3–5 close alternatives with a one-line contrast (e.g., “better low-light camera,” “shorter queue but smaller collection,” “spicier/region-authentic,” “more durable but heavier”).
   - For **PEOPLE**, include 3–5 notable outputs/teams/companies with a one-line “why it matters,” plus 2–4 peer comparators.

9) Verdict
   - Clear bottom line with caveats. If scores diverge, explain why (e.g., professional tests vs. owner-reported reliability; critics loving ambition vs. users citing usability/crowds/price). Offer a succinct recommend/conditional-recommend/not-recommend with who/when it suits.

METHOD NOTES
- Prefer the most recent, credible sources; include access dates. Note if paywalled sources informed conclusions.
- Avoid confirmation bias: deliberately seek contrary views, including from rationalist/rational-adjacent communities and regional forums when relevant.
- Be transparent about uncertainty (early access, small sample size, regional model differences, recent reformulation/chef change, job/role changes for people).
- Keep quotes impactful; do not fabricate. Always link.
- Where scores differ by edition/region/platform/branch/person-role, keep them separate and explain.
