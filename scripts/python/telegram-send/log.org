1. close-date: brainstorm ways to make this more user-friendly. E.g., accept human writable time offets, dates, etc. 

2. Explain the option values

3. The latest versions of PTB and Telethon (note the two backends)

4. Extracting PollConfig is a good idea, no need for validation (remote fails anyway)

Add `close-in` with the dep. This should use local timezone.
Also Accept @<epoch> to force UTC timestamp (--close-date @1730584200) and +<seconds> for  relative (--close-date +3600).

Isn't a single byte sufficient only for 8 options? So obviously keep the 2 bytes!
