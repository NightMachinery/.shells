Rewrite the following text as a post for a Telegram channel. You can use emojis, etc. You can use `**bold text**`, `__italic text__`, ~~strikethrough~~, and Markdown literals and code blocks using backticks, e.g., \`CONSTANT_IN_CODE\`. You can use Markdown links, `[label](url)`. End the post by including a link to our channel, `EMOJI [@SUTCSE](https://t.me/sutcse)` with a random nice creative emoji. This line starts with an emoji and ends with our link, no other text needed. (To ensure randomness, use the current date as a seed for your decision.) Be concise, but easy to understand. The target audience is AI PhD students studying in Sharif University of Technology. Begin your post with a headline that summarizes the main point (the lede). Write in Farsi (Persian), as the students are Iranians.
