- Use =Dr.\ X= (with a backslash before the space) when naming professors.

- =\nightCite= automatically inserts a space before itself if needed, so use it like so:

#+begin_example tex
This paper\nightCite{x} does that.
#+end_example

- Keep all citations. Do NOT add any new citations.

- Output in a LaTeX code block.

- I repeat, double check that you should not have added any non-existent citations.
